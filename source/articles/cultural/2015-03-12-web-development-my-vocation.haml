    %h1 Web Development, my vocation
  %section
    %p I thought about what I wanted my first post to be on my new blog site and it will be about the technology on this site, but more so I wanted to share my motivation as to why I wanted to maintain a blog site.
    %p This blog is an expression of who I am. I am a web developer. This is only a small part of who I am, but strangely enough, it is what I feel most at home at right now.

    %h3 Vocation
    %p Vocation is a powerful word to me. It is something which resonates strongly with my core values, my interests. It is not a job, not a career. A vocation is more powerful than that. More <i>real</i>. An extension of who I am, going out in the world and contributing what I have to give.
    %p That sounds pretty deep and honestly, I always thought of my vocation being more romantic than web development somehow. Like building a school in Vietnam or Cambodia. And when I still had no clue what I wanted to do when I would grow up (About two years ago.), I actually did things similar to that and while I found value in it, it wasn't a big enough draw for me to keep doing that.
    READMORE
    %p So maybe it would be something I could mention and I would be instantly cool, like being a SCUBA diving or snowboarding instructor. And those are things I came close to or deeply considered as well. And while I still love this things and will keep doing those things, it is not something that I can pour myself into. Probably for a year, maybe even two, but not much longer than that.
    %p And while I have not even been a year on this path, I deeply know that this is what I want to be when I grow up. And that's what I'm doing. Maybe that means I finally grew up.

    %h3 Happiness
    %p Another loaded word. I now understand happiness not to be a constant state of joy, but really a deeper, more low key satisfaction pervading all aspects of life. Even when I may feel shitty for some reason, that is just something for me to check if I am still on my own path. And for the last few years the answer to that question hasn't always been swift and resounding, but it's always been 'Yes'. I believe that is a blessing.
    %p When I look at my life when I was ready to chuck in my job, sell my house and go live out of my backpack until I found what I wanted to do my circumstances didn't look all that much different, yet everything feels better now. This isn't just about becoming a web developer, it's bringing my life into alignment with who I am, what I value.
    %p At this point if somehow you are reading this, but don't know about web development, I can tell you what makes it so great to me. First of all it excites me to be able to work with edge technology and forward thinking people. To be able to have an idea and make it real and accessible. Working with new technologies means there are always problems to solve. In management terms those would be called challenges. I like to think of them as puzzles.
    %p I think writing code and seeing things happen is about as close to wizardry as we get in our world. Writing working code is like turning out some incantation. Of course it's not magic. You can reduce it all down to logic, but at the deepest core of you are just getting more detailed descriptions and we still don't know what those are based on. I'll stop here before I get more philosophical. But figuring out how things work, what things are made of has always been fascinating to me. This is why web development fits like a glove. It also never ever stops. Technology only increases and deepens. I have a life long of learning ahead of me and I love that idea.

    %h3 This blog
    %p I might write more on this or I might not. My next post will be of a technical nature and mostly focus on what I used to build this blog. Further down the line I will share what I figured out and isn't already clear or easy to find.
    %p I think it's a great way of contributing to the technical community. Personally I cannot count the times when a great blog post helped me out in solving a technical issue I was facing, providing me with concise wording and clear examples. It is my goal to return that favor as often as I have the chance to do so.
